## ‚öôÔ∏è **Email Configuration Setup**

### **Step 1: Configure Email Settings**

Edit the `email_config.py` file with your email provider details:

```python
# Gmail Configuration (Recommended)
MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'
MAIL_PORT = 587
MAIL_USE_TLS = True
MAIL_USE_SSL = False

# Your Gmail credentials
MAIL_USERNAME = 'your-email@gmail.com'  # Replace with your Gmail
MAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'     # Replace with your Gmail App Password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'your-email@gmail.com'  # Replace with your Gmail
```

### **Step 2: Gmail App Password Setup**

For Gmail users, you need to create an App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google account
2. Go to **Google Account settings** > **Security** > **App passwords**
3. Generate an app password for "Mail"
4. Use that password in `MAIL_PASSWORD` above
5. **Never use your regular Gmail password**

### **Step 3: Alternative Email Providers**

#### **Outlook/Hotmail:**
```python
MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp-mail.outlook.com'
MAIL_PORT = 587
MAIL_USE_TLS = True
MAIL_USE_SSL = False
MAIL_USERNAME = 'your-email@outlook.com'
MAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'your-email@outlook.com'
```

#### **Yahoo:**
```python
MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.mail.yahoo.com'
MAIL_PORT = 587
MAIL_USE_TLS = True
MAIL_USE_SSL = False
MAIL_USERNAME = 'your-email@yahoo.com'
MAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'your-email@yahoo.com'
```

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Setup**

### **Add Email Addresses to Patients**

The system requires patient email addresses in the database. You can add them manually or update the database:

```sql
-- Add email column if not exists
ALTER TABLE risk_training ADD COLUMN EMAIL TEXT;

-- Update patient emails (example)
UPDATE risk_training 
SET EMAIL = 'patient@example.com' 
WHERE DESYNPUF_ID = 'PATIENT_ID';
```
